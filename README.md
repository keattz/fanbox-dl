# fanbox-dl

Usage (aka stuff you'd know if you had run `fanbox-dl --help`):
* You'll need to save the value of your FANBOXSESSID cookie in a text file somewhere. Point to that file with the `-c` option when executing the script.
* You can use the `-o` option to set the output directory.
* Files are not overwritten by default; use `--clobber` to enable this.
* After the options, pass the creator's username as the only argument.
